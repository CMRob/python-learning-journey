Hi, I’m Rob 👋

This is a personal repository to track my Python learning and growth as I expand my technical skills in support of solutions engineering roles in the AI and SaaS space.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

- Python basics (variables, functions, loops, etc.)
- REST APIs and automation workflows
- Integration patterns for AI tools like ElevenLabs

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/scripts` — Simple Python scripts and experiments
- `/notes` — Markdown notes and takeaways from my learning
- `/projects` — Mini projects or examples of real-world use

## 🔧 Tools & Platforms

- [Codecademy: Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) for Voice AI experimentation

## 💡 Why This Matters

I’m passionate about simplifying technical problems for customers and applying what I learn to build better demos, integrations, and enablement content. This repo reflects that journey.
